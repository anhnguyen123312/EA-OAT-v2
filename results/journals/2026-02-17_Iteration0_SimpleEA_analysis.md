# Trade Journal: Iteration 0 - SimpleEA Workflow Validation

**Date:** 2026-02-17
**EA:** SimpleEA (workflow validation placeholder)
**Symbol:** XAUUSD M5
**Period:** 2023.01.01 - 2026.02.01
**Model:** Real Ticks (Model=4)
**Deposit:** $1,000

---

## Executive Summary

**Purpose:** Validate the full automation pipeline: compile → backtest → CSV export → analysis.

**Result:** ✅ **PIPELINE VALIDATED** - The workflow is functional and ready for AdvancedEA.

**Trading Performance:** ❌ **NOT APPLICABLE** - SimpleEA has no real trading strategy.

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Win Rate | 19.80% | ≥80% | ❌ N/A |
| R:R | 0.46 | ≥2.0 | ❌ N/A |
| Trades/Day | ~0.18 | ≥10 | ❌ N/A |
| Max DD | 100.18% | <10% | ❌ N/A |
| Net Profit | -$1,001.90 | Positive | ❌ N/A |
| Total Trades | 197 | - | - |

**Note:** These metrics reflect a placeholder EA with no strategy logic. They are NOT indicative of expected AdvancedEA performance.

---

## Trade Classification

**Cannot classify trades** - SimpleEA does not output SMC component metadata (BOS, OB, FVG, Sweep, MTF).

For reference, when AdvancedEA results are available, classification will be:

| Class | Definition | Analysis Focus |
|-------|------------|----------------|
| CORRECT_WIN | Entry signal valid, target hit | Replicate conditions |
| CORRECT_LOSS | Entry valid, stopped out (acceptable) | SL placement optimization |
| FALSE_SIGNAL | Entry should not have triggered | Improve signal filtering |
| BAD_TIMING | Good setup, wrong entry timing | Entry timing optimization |
| MISSED_EXIT | Should have exited earlier | TP optimization |

---

## Pipeline Validation Checklist

| Step | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| MT5 Compile | ✅ PASS | SimpleEA.mq5 compiled with zero errors |
| Backtest Execution | ✅ PASS | 3-year backtest completed without crash |
| CSV Export | ✅ PASS | OnTester() exported CSV with FILE_COMMON flag |
| CSV Copy to results/ | ✅ PASS | File copied successfully |
| CSV Parsing | ✅ PASS | All 32 metrics readable |
| UTF-16LE → UTF-8 | ✅ PASS | Encoding handled correctly |

---

## Lessons Learned for AdvancedEA

### 1. OnTester() CSV Format
- Use FILE_ANSI flag for UTF-8 output (avoid encoding issues)
- Include all standard TesterStatistics metrics
- Add SMC-specific columns for backtester analysis:
  - `Avg_SMC_Score_All`
  - `Avg_SMC_Score_Winners`
  - `Avg_SMC_Score_Losers`
  - `Score_100_119_Count`
  - `Score_120_149_Count`
  - `Score_150_199_Count`
  - `Score_200_Plus_Count`

### 2. Trade Comment Format
AdvancedEA must include in trade comment:
```
SMC:XXX|BOS:Y|SW:Y|OB:Y|FVG:Y|MTF:Y
```
This enables pattern-based analysis.

### 3. Real Ticks Model
- Model=4 (real ticks) provides most accurate results
- 1-min OHLC (Model=1) is faster but less accurate
- Use Model=4 for final validation, Model=1 for parameter sweeps

## Root Cause Analysis (SimpleEA Failure)

**Why did SimpleEA blow up?**
1. No real entry logic - placeholder signals only
2. No confluence scoring - entries on any price movement
3. No risk management validation - no daily MDD circuit breaker
4. No SMC pattern detection - no structure-based decisions

**How AdvancedEA will be different:**
1. 5 SMC detectors (BOS, Sweep, OB, FVG, MTF)
2. Confluence scoring (≥100 points required)
3. 0.5% risk per trade, 8% daily MDD halt
4. R:R ≥ 2.0 enforced
5. Trigger candle confirmation

---

## Next Steps

1. **Coder (Task #5):** Implement AdvancedEA.mq5 per CODER_TASK_AdvancedEA.md v1.01
2. **Coder:** Compile with zero errors/warnings
3. **Coder:** Run 3-year backtest with config/active/autobacktest.ini
4. **Coder:** Export CSV to results/
5. **Backtester (Task #6):** Analyze AdvancedEA results with trade classification
6. **Backtester:** Create optimization plan if targets not met

---

## Blocking Status

**Task #6 (Backtester) is BLOCKED** pending Task #5 (Coder) completion.

This document serves as:
- ✅ Iteration 0 workflow validation record
- ✅ Framework template for AdvancedEA analysis
- ⏳ Placeholder for trade-by-trade classification (awaiting AdvancedEA CSV)
